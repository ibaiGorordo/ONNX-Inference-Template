# ONNX-Inference-Template
 Template project for performing inference on ONNX models in Python.

# Why
 Most of the ONNX inference examples I produce have the same structure, I just created this repository to reduce having to copy paste things from older projects. I wanted to share it in case it helps someone in their project.

# Important
 The code will crash if not modified, the names of the model as well as the links to the videos, images and models need to be fixed.
